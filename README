Pre-requisites

Django >= 1.4 (available in pip) 
Numpy, probably, for scoring

Running on a local machine
--------------------------
To run on a local machine:
cd great3
./reset

You will be prompted to set a password for a super-user called jaz.  Pick 
anything.

You can then open the homepage on
http://127.0.0.1:8000/

If you want you can log in as "jaz" with the password you just created, or one of 
the other pre-created users : "mike", "barney", or "rachel".  In each case the 
password is just the username.

You can then explore the site and submit entries to exising leaderboards!

New Users
---------
From the login tab you have the option of creating new users.  The email that
would be sent to the new user on creation is stored as a text file in 
server/emails, until we connect to a real SMTP server.  We can customize new 
user creation easily if, for example, we wanted to ask for full names, 
institutions, etc.

Admin
-----

The admin site (which only the super user jaz can access)  is at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin.  This is where we will create new leaderboards.

Scoring
-------

The scoring of entries will be done using a cron job every few minutes which checks
for new entries and then computes their scores.  This is an external process so 
that the site does not hang when processing.  The command to be run (from the  
server/great3 dir) is:

python manage.py great3_scores

At the moment the scores are random, until we have the metric code ready.

Deployment
----------
Things to do before deploying (not complete!):
 - remove the initial yaml data 
 - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/
 - change the secret key (settings.py)
 - set the admin user (settings.py)
 - set the database settings in great3/settings.py to correct (e.g. MySQL)
   values (settings.py)
 - change the email backend (settings.py)
 - update the site settings in the admin controls
