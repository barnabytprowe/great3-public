# GREAT3 validation scripts
===========================

The scripts in this directory were used to validate the GREAT3 simulation data
for full public release.

The contents are as follows:

1. `compare_md5sums.py` compares the md5sum output generated by `get_md5sums.py`
(see below).

2. `constants.py` is a short Python module that stores directory paths for the
the GREAT3 data, lists allowing you to specify the branches you wish to run on,
and some dictionaries storing information about early (internal) shape
measurement submissions that were used for validation.

3. `count_objects.py` is a command line executable script for running SExtractor
(Bertin & Arnouts 1998) on all FITS files in a given GREAT3 experiment using a
sensible default config (chosen after some trial and error) to determine object
counts for GREAT3 images.
