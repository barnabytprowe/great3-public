GREAT3 Hacking
==============

Please use this folder to put your GREAT3 plotting scripts and analysis
routines.  Good docstrings *always* welcomed!

Note on individual scripts
==========================

The ellipse_videos.py script generates little videos showing how the best mplus and mminus for the best scoring entry for each team changed with time.  Needs lots of work.
