GREAT3 Hacking
==============

Please use this folder to put your GREAT3 plotting scripts and analysis
routines.  Good docstrings *always* welcomed!

The files `export.csv` and `export.fits` contain the basic information about
the GREAT3 submissions (all info currently available on the webpage) in comma-
separated value and FITS formats, respectively.  Many thanks to @joezuntz for
putting this together from the Leaderboard Webpage database.

Please see https://github.com/barnabytprowe/great3-public/issues/20 for more
information and discussion about these plots.

If you want to add your own analysis code to this repository, please make a Pull
Request and we'll bring it in.

Have fun!

Notes on individual scripts
===========================

* `ellipse_videos.py`: this script generates little videos showing how the best
mplus and mminus for the best scoring entry for each team changed with time.
Needs lots of work.  Author: @joezuntz
