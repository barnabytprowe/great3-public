\title{Why Have We Updated the Metrics for GREAT3?}

You may have noticed that your metric scores in the GREAT3
Leaderboards have changed slightly.  These changes will be most
noticeable for the highest scoring entries, but \emph{all} scores have
changed by some amount.  This document will explain why these change
were made, and give the definitions of the new metrics.

\section{Background}
As mentioned in the first versions of the GREAT3 Handbook (Mandelbaum
et al 2013), we always felt it
might be necessary to update the metrics as we received more
information about methods in the form of entries to GREAT3.  In
particular we felt it might be necessary to \emph{renormalize} the
metrics, to make it so that a method scores $\sim 1000$ if it reaches
target performance.

So why would either the constant shear metric ($Q_{\rm c}$) or
variable shear metric ($Q_{\rm v}$) need renormalization?

To answer this question, let us consider a simple model of the
contributions to an observation of a (complex) gravitational shear $g_{\rm obs}$.
We may write this as a combination of the gravitational reduced shear $g$, galaxy intrinsic ellipticity
$g_{\rm int}$, and a measurement noise term $g_{\rm noise}$ due to the
noise on image pixels:
\begin{equation}
g_{\rm obs} \simeq g + g_{\rm int} + g_{\rm noise}.
\end{equation}
As they are both noise terms as far as shear measurement is concerned,
it is common in weak lensing to refer to $g_{\rm int}$ as \emph{shape
  noise} and $g_{\rm noise}$ as \emph{measurement noise} (this sounds
better than `noise noise').
In GREAT3 we have designed our experiments with inherent symmetries
that allow us to cancel the intrinsic ellipticity
