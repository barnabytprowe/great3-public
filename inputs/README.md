# Simulation inputs
===================

This directory contains a few subdirectories for various pieces of information
that have to be input into the simulations:

- atmospsf/ contains work related to the atmospheric PSF anisotropy power
  spectra.

- galdata/ contains scripts that were used to prepare the galaxy samples.

- optical-psfs/ contains information about the optical PSF models.

- shear-ps/ contains information about the lensing shear power spectra.

The README's and files in these directories contain more information.
