We need some shear power spectra to use as inputs for the GREAT3 challenge.  There are a few things
to do here:

1) Take some power spectra from iCosmo for reasonable cosmologies and surveys.  This requires use of
IDL scripts that will live in this directory.  To begin with, let's choose fiducial cosmology and a
range of cosmologies within which we'll randomly sample parameters:

      a) Proposal for fiducial: w_0=-1, w_a=0, sigma_8=0.8, n_s=0.96, H_0=70h km/s/Mpc,
      Omega_m=0.25, Omega_b=something WMAP7-ish (check)

      b) Range: go to +/-1 sigma in these parameters
         sigma(w_0) = 0.2
         sigma(sigma_8) = 0.05
         sigma(n_s) = 0.02
         sigma(H_0) = 2h km/s/Mpc
         sigma(Omega_m) = something motivated by WMAP7-ish errors
         sigma(Omega_b) = something motivated by WMAP7-ish errors
         [ don't draw randomly for now, just make a grid ]

And choose survey parameters: let's ignore tomography and just use default iCosmo N(z) with various
z_med = 0.75, 1.00, 1.25.

So for the fiducial cosmology we'll have 3 cosmic shear power spectra, and once we vary cosmology
up and down we'll have 2 x 3 x 6 = 36.

2) Examine the power spectra for the ranges of k that we will use.  Can we approximate them with a
simple functional form? (doesn't have to be perfect, just somewhat realistic)

3) Do we want to consider some variations on that functional form so that challenge won't be too
easy?

Ultimately we might want to stick some of the tabulated power spectra into GalSim.
