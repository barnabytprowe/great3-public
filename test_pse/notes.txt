This directory contains some files that can be used as a test of the
power spectrum estimation code.  They contain gridded shears from
Chris Hirata's SHT code, with a setup that differs slightly from that
in GREAT3; the inputs to PowerSpectrumEstimator should be:

N = 50 (rather than 100)
sky_size_deg = 10.

The input PS given to Chris's code is in ps.wmap7lcdm.2000.dat, which
is a prediction for zmed=0.55 for WMAP7 cosmological parameters. The
columns are ell and C_ell.  The reason for the change in N compared to
GREAT3 is that this file happens to only be defined for ell<2000, and
a GREAT3 grid with N=100 has grid spacing of 0.1 degrees, so ell_max =
(2pi*180)/(pi*0.1) = 3600.  If we have only 50 grid points but still
cover 10 degrees with our grid, then ell_max=1800 which is safely
<2000.

I made 15 realizations:

* 5 for P_E=P(k), P_B=0
* 5 for P_B=P(k), P_E=0
* 5 for P_E=P_B=P(k)

The 5 realizations for each case should give some idea of how much
variation there can be from the ideal just due to noise.  I can make
more if needed, or with a different power spectrum.

The files are gridshear.$strp.$i.out for $i=1...5 and $strp=(pe, pe,
pepb).  The four columns are x, y, g1, g2, whereas Joe's code wants 2d
arrays of g1 and g2, so some manipulation will have to be done to give
these to his code.  I also worry about sign flips for one shear
component.

I used a version of Chris's code with 6144 pixelization as input to
the SHT because our grid is lower resolution than GREAT3's, and the
following commands:
